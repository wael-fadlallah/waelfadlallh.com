This privacy policy applies to the Wakey: Wake Up Alarms (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Wael Fadlallh (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

### 1. Information Collection and Use

To provide a personalized experience, the Application includes an optional onboarding step where you may provide your name.

- **Optional User Name:** Providing your name is entirely **optional**. You can skip this step and continue using all features of the Application without providing any personal identification.
- **Strictly Local Storage:** If you choose to provide a name, it is **stored locally on your device only**. We do not transmit, upload, or store your name on any external servers or databases.
- **Purpose:** Your name is used solely within the Application to personalize the interface and greetings.

**Note on Location:** The Application **does NOT** collect, transmit, or use your device's geographical location or GPS data.

### 2. Third-Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application. We utilize:

- **Expo:** Used for framework stability and performance monitoring. Please refer to [Expo's Privacy Policy](https://expo.io/privacy) for details.

We do not share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion

- **User Control:** Since your name is stored locally, you can update or delete it at any time within the Application's settings.
- **Uninstalling:** Uninstalling the Application will automatically delete all locally stored data, including your name, from your device.

### 4. Children's Privacy

The Application does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. As the Application stores data locally and does not send it to a server, we do not have access to any data provided by children.

### 5. Security

We prioritize the security of your information. By storing your name locally on your device rather than on a cloud server, we eliminate the risk of server-side data breaches or unauthorized remote access.

### 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, please contact us at **wael.fudlallah@gmail.com**.
